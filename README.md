# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate - Practice files

This repo is part of my learning experience while working through my Google IT Automation with Python Cert
I used this space to:
 -follow along with the course material and assignments.
 -To try out basic Git and Github commands.

 ## Why this repo looks kinda messy (or strangely empty)
 I'm still new to Github and I'm figuring it out one step at a time.

 i tried pushed,pulled, and committed
 But honestly,I'm not always sure **what** i pushed,pulled or commited.
 
  ## This repo probably contains:
- Some beginner-level mistakes
- Maybe broken or incomplete files
- Some copied course material I tried to follow along with

## What i learnt any way
 -How to use AI to navigate my way through Github :)
 -Basic commands like 'git init','git push','git commit' etc(in practice).
 -That messing up is part of my learning and I'm okay with that.
